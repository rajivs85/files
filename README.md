# Depth-From-Defocus-Matlab
This is a Matlab implementation of Depth from Defocus using your mobile phone. In addition I use a number of techniques such as graph cuts and matting laplacian to improve the results

This Repo is the implementation of the following paper:

* [ImageMatting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4359322/) A Closed form solution to natural image matting
* [WMF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6751115) Constant Time Weighted Median Filtering for Stereo Matching and Beyond


### Prerequisites
1. Download IAT tool box from following link:
```

```
2. i have provided graph cut library which does not belong to me.Follow instruction on gc-v.30 for any problems:

### Dataset 
Two different datasets have been included in the repository. You can also create your own by getting a whole focal stack from your phones.

## Steps
 The following steps are performed:
 
### Step1 
Sample Image from Focal Stack
